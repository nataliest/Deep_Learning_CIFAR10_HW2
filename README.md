# Deep_Learning_CIFAR10_HW2

NYU CS-GY 9223 Homework 2: CIFAR10 classification using CNN

The architecture is based on SimpleNet: https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06037

Modifications:
– L2 regularizer
– Data augmentation
– Fully-connected layer before the last, softmax layer

SimpleNet implementation published here https://github.com/Coderx7/SimpleNet is written in Caffe; my implementation is in Tensorflow.
